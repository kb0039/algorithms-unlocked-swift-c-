# algorithms-unlocked-swift-c-
Personal notes and solutions for each example algorithms in Algorithms Unlocked book by Thomas Cormen. I wrote the chapter proecdures in Swift & C++ (may compile in C as well). I will update this repository after each chapter is completed as an accountability tactic. Feel free to suggest solutions to optimize as you see fit. Enjoy.
