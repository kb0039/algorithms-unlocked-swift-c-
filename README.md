# algorithms-unlocked-swift-c-
Personal notes and solutions for each example algorithms in Algorithms Unlocked book by Thomas Cormen. I wrote the chapter proecdures in Swift & C++ (may compile in C as well). I will update this repository after each chapter is completed as an accountability tactic. Feel free to suggest solutions and optimize as you see fit. Enjoy. 


## Usage & Installtion

### Swift (.playground)

> **Swift files require Swift Compiler Swift 4.X and Xcode 9.X+
> - [Download Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
> - Once the installion is finished, simply click on the files and run the program in the Xcode playground.

### C++ (.cpp)

You can simply run the executable files the with the following commands in Linux or Mac OS X:

First: Access the correct directory
```bash
$ cd YourSourcePath/"Algorithms Unlocked"/src/C++/ch2
```

Then run executable in that folder:

```bash
$ ./LinearSearch
```

Or you can use your own IDE or download [CLION](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/).

### C# (VS or VS Code)

> - [Download Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
> - Once the installion is finished, simply doule-click on the .sln file in the desired path and run the program in your IDE.
> - You can also run the program via Terminal in Linux or Mac OSX (See Below)

First: Access the correct directory
```bash
$ cd YourSourcePath/"Algorithms Unlocked"/src/C++/ch3/MergeSort
```

Then run the two commands in your current directory:

```bash
$ dotnet build
$ dotnet run
```
